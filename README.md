# legacySimplifyMod
Simplifies Orteil's NeverEnding Legacy game to have only functionally important things

The overall goal is to reduce some of the mostly-unused extra (distracting) complexity and make the game have an easier-to-understand, slower, more distinct, and more linear stage-progression (baskets should always come before Granaries, etc).

First, going to remove the Muddy Water / Spoiled Food mechanic and just have water/food or no water/food. (maybe re-add much later)
Second, going to make the subFood have more obvious Tiers and show the actual attribute impacts in the tooltips (raw meat: -.03 health)

Going to re-tool the food-gathering percentages to make the tribe much more food-gathering dependent early on, and so allow the technology gains (baskets, pots) to have very obviously-impactful effects that allows major changes to tribe labor-distribution ratios.
